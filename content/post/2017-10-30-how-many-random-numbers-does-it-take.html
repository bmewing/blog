<h2>Fermat and his library</h2>
<p>This morning I woke up to a delightful tweet from fermatslibrary about sample random uniform numbers and how many it takes, on average, to sum to 1.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
Pick a uniformly random number in [0,1] and repeat until the sum of the numbers picked is &gt;1. You'll on average pick e≈2.718… numbers! <a href="https://t.co/8ak1hYENCi">pic.twitter.com/8ak1hYENCi</a>

<p>If you look at the embedded picture, you can see the math sketched out but of course it’s alwasy more fun to simulate.</p>

<div id="some-r-code" class="section level2">
<h2>Some R Code</h2>
<p>How can we generate a random uniform [0,1] number in R? There are many distributions built in and this one is included. Note, I’m setting a seed to ensure if you’re following along at home you will get the same answer. <code>runif</code> is the function which generates random values, by default <em>min</em> is 0 and <em>max</em> is 1 (just what we want).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1001)
runif(n = 1,min = 0,max = 1)
## [1] 0.9856888</code></pre>
<p>We can visually ‘verify’ the distribution we’re drawing from with a histogram. While it’s not totally flat, it’s fairly obvious that it’s uniformly sampling values between 0 and 1.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(runif(10000), main = &quot;Histogram of 10,000 Random Uniform [0,1] Values&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="how-many-are-needed" class="section level3">
<h3>How many are needed?</h3>
<p>To determine how many values are needed to sum to 1, we’ll use a <code>while</code> loop. This is a loop that will cycle until a logical condition is satisified. It’s like a <code>for</code> loop except it has the potential to be an infinite loop.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summedValue = 0
steps = 0
while(summedValue &lt; 1){
  summedValue = summedValue + runif(1)
  steps = steps+1
}
cat(&quot;Total Summed Value:&quot;,summedValue,&quot;\n&quot;)
## Total Summed Value: 1.753755
cat(&quot;It took &quot;,steps,&quot; step&quot;,ifelse(steps==1,&quot;&quot;,&quot;s&quot;),&quot; to get there\n&quot;,sep=&quot;&quot;)
## It took 2 steps to get there</code></pre>
<p>This is great! We can see to total value, and how many values were drawn to get to 1. But now we need to do this lots of times.</p>
</div>
<div id="functional-programming" class="section level3">
<h3>Functional programming</h3>
<p>By wrapping our above code in a function we’ll be able to take advantage of functional programming. Note how the function is mostly a wrapper and all that’s changed is we replaced the <code>cat</code> steps with a <code>return</code> argument (what the function will return as a value).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>countUnif = function(){
  summedValue = 0
  steps = 0
  while(summedValue &lt; 1){
    summedValue = summedValue+runif(1)
    steps = steps+1
  }
  return(steps)
}

countUnif()
## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>Now we can simulate this many, many times. The <code>replicate</code> function makes it very easy to generate 1,000,000 experiments.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>results = replicate(1000000,countUnif())
cat(&quot;Average values required from simulation:&quot;,mean(results),&quot;\n&quot;)
## Average values required from simulation: 2.717411
cat(&quot;Average values required from math      :&quot;,exp(1),&quot;\n&quot;)
## Average values required from math      : 2.718282</code></pre>
<p>Wow! That’s really close. But I’d really like to see how the value stabilizes over time. So, I’d like a cumulative average.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cumulativeAverage = cumsum(results)/(1:1000000)</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Zoom and enhance! Here we can see that we’re not necessarily stabilizing,but the movement is all in a very small range.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(cumulativeAverage,type=&#39;l&#39;,main=&#39;Average Random Uniform [0,1] Values Needed to Sum to 1&#39;,ylab=&#39;Cumulative Average&#39;,ylim=c(2.715,2.72))
