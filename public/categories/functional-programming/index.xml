      <description>All Subsets RegressionWhat is all subsets regression? It’s a technique for model building which involves taking a set of independent variables \(X_1..i\) and regressing them in sets of \(k\), where \(k\) is in \(\{1,2,\dots,i\}\), against the response variable \(Y\). The ‘all’ part of ‘all subsets’ means it’s every combination of \(X_{1..i}\) being drawn \(k\) at a time.
But…why?You’re probably familiar with forward, backward or stepwise model building where terms are added (or removed) from a model one at a time while attempting to maximize or minimize some ‘goodness’ criteria.</description>
