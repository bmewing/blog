      <description>IntroFor the last several years I’ve participated in a reading challenge with a few family members. It’s a custom derivative of the POPSUGAR list and in general it’s great for encouraging reading outside of my normal choices (though I suppose I’ve been doing it long enough that maybe I have broader taste now?). This year one item is to read a book published the month of your birthday. As I was researching options, my 9 year old started trying to estimate the probability that a book was published on your birthday.</description>

      <title>Analysis of R User Salaries from the 2019 StackOverflow Survey</title>

      <description>IntroSaw an interesting analysis pop up in my Twitter feed, written by Tomaž Weiss and posted on KDNuggets analyzing the 2019 StackOverflow survey data to look at salaries of R Users. As is often the case, my brain went down a rabbit trail of new questions to ask.
DataThe data is available in a zip file from here, I uploaded just the results to an S3 bucket to make my analysis reproducible (though I would prefer if you downloaded from the original source instead of my bucket so I don’t have to pay for it).</description>

      <title>A Tale of Three Assignment Operators</title>

      <description>The PlayersFirst, let’s meet the players.
&amp;lt;- The classic R assignment operator. It’s been around since the beginning ostensibly because there was actually a key for it back then.= The assignment operator used by nearly every other programming language in the world&amp;lt;&amp;lt;- The deep assignment operator, it exists only to commit sedition. And assign values to variables in other environments.-&amp;gt; and -&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The weird cousin that nobody likes to sit next to at family reunions.</description>

      <title>mgsub v1.0 Launched to CRAN</title>

      <description>Official CRAN LaunchEarlier this week I submitted mgsub to CRAN and after a couple of days it was accepted! Now it’s live! I’m very excited to have published my second package and one that I think is a more valuable contribution than my first. The package represented a few firsts for me. The first package that I wrote tests for, checked code coverage on and for which I wrote a vignette.</description>

      <title>One Year of Trump Executive Orders</title>
      <link>/post/2018-01-25-one-year-of-trump-eo/</link>

      <guid>/post/2018-01-25-one-year-of-trump-eo/</guid>
      <description>First YearLess than a week ago marked the end of Trump’s first year in office. Back in August I posted code on analyzing the issuing of Executive Orders. Today I’m just going to provide updated commentary.
NotesThe Federal Register takes time to actually publish Executive Orders. This window is variable but has a median value of 5 days. That’s why this post is coming out on the 25th instead of the 20th.</description>

      <title>Safe, Multiple String Substitutions with mgsub::mgsub</title>
      <link>/post/2018-01-10-safe-multiple-string-substitutions/</link>

      <guid>/post/2018-01-10-safe-multiple-string-substitutions/</guid>
      <description>String substitutionsNote - the package I wrote was originally inspired by a challenge a coworker tossed out. It also happened to provide a solution to this SO question which was really cool!
Substitutions in strings are best handled with regular expressions which are an amazingly powerful and flexible tool. Regular expressions are a way of expressing patterns in strings. In the example below I want to find the four letters, “dopa” and replace them with “meta”.</description>

      <description>Fermat and his libraryThis morning I woke up to a delightful tweet from fermatslibrary about sample random uniform numbers and how many it takes, on average, to sum to 1.
Pick a uniformly random number in [0,1] and repeat until the sum of the numbers picked is &amp;gt;1. You&#39;ll on average pick e≈2.718… numbers! pic.twitter.com/8ak1hYENCi— Fermat&#39;s Library (@fermatslibrary) October 28, 2017If you look at the embedded picture, you can see the math sketched out but of course it’s alwasy more fun to simulate.</description>

      <description>Learning the hard wayAbout a month ago David Robinson made a tweet that I both agree and disagree with.
New blog post: “Don&#39;t teach students the hard way first” https://t.co/X2drh1tQe5 #rstats pic.twitter.com/GXAEpx5eET— David Robinson (@drob) September 21, 2017His example is simple enough - you’re going to a friends new house and are provided with directions involving a lot of back roads, twisting and turning. When you arrive you’re told to just take the highway back because it’s easier.</description>

      <title>purrr Tricks with All Subset Regression</title>
      <link>/post/2017-08-24-purrr-tricks-with-all-subset-regression/</link>

      <guid>/post/2017-08-24-purrr-tricks-with-all-subset-regression/</guid>
      <description>All Subsets RegressionWhat is all subsets regression? It’s a technique for model building which involves taking a set of independent variables \(X_1..i\) and regressing them in sets of \(k\), where \(k\) is in \(\{1,2,\dots,i\}\), against the response variable \(Y\). The ‘all’ part of ‘all subsets’ means it’s every combination of \(X_{1..i}\) being drawn \(k\) at a time.
But…why?You’re probably familiar with forward, backward or stepwise model building where terms are added (or removed) from a model one at a time while attempting to maximize or minimize some ‘goodness’ criteria.</description>

      <description>Executive Orders in the USAFrom Wikipedia:
Executive orders are orders issued by United States Presidents and directed towards officers and agencies of the U.S. federal government. Executive orders have the full force of law, based on the authority derived from statute or the Constitution itself. The ability to make such orders is also based on express or implied Acts of Congress that delegate to the President some degree of discretionary power (delegated legislation).</description>

      <description>blogdown magicI made this blog using the magic of blogdown which is a framework that joins together a few technologies to make ‘static websites’
RMarkdownHugoRMarkdownRMarkdown is an interface from R to markdown which is a way of marking up a text document with formating so other tools can convert it from a text file to a pretty format (PDF, Word, etc.) It’s a great way of documenting your code by having your narrative right next to the code that generated the insights/results.</description>

      <description>Theta JoinsCommon Joins
If you’re like me, you’re looking at that diagram wondering what the heck is a ‘theta’ join?! Well, that’s the formal name for a ‘fuzzy’ join. In fact, you can read about all the different join types in this StackOverflow answer.
An equi join is the most common kind of join because it leverages keys in your data source which are essential in a SQL environment.</description>
