      <description>Executive Orders in the USAFrom Wikipedia:
Executive orders are orders issued by United States Presidents and directed towards officers and agencies of the U.S. federal government. Executive orders have the full force of law, based on the authority derived from statute or the Constitution itself. The ability to make such orders is also based on express or implied Acts of Congress that delegate to the President some degree of discretionary power (delegated legislation).</description>

      <description>blogdown magicI made this blog using the magic of blogdown which is a framework that joins together a few technologies to make ‘static websites’
RMarkdownHugoRMarkdownRMarkdown is an interface from R to markdown which is a way of marking up a text document with formating so other tools can convert it from a text file to a pretty format (PDF, Word, etc.) It’s a great way of documenting your code by having your narrative right next to the code that generated the insights/results.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Mark Ewing. I&amp;rsquo;m just some guy who currently lives in the northeast part of Tennessee, just barely too far from Asheville, NC to drink Wicked Weed beer every weekend. I work for a big company doing a bunch of stuff and often that stuff involves R. I love R. I mean, not in a creepy way, yet most people still find it creepy. I first learned R in a linear algebra class in college back in 2006 and used it until I finished my masters degree in Applied Statistics.</description>

      <description>Theta JoinsCommon Joins
If you’re like me, you’re looking at that diagram wondering what the heck is a ‘theta’ join?! Well, that’s the formal name for a ‘fuzzy’ join. In fact, you can read about all the different join types in this StackOverflow answer.
An equi join is the most common kind of join because it leverages keys in your data source which are essential in a SQL environment.</description>

      <title>Installing Your First Spark Cluster</title>

      <description>Installing your first spark clusterSo, if you’re like me you’ve been using a lot of traditional tools for data science/analytics/whatever you want to call it. R is great, it’s flexible, it’s powerful but it’s slow and memory constrained. At work I’ve got a VM with 16Gb and one call can increase it. At home I’ve got an 8 Gb machine and honestly, it works fine for what I do here.</description>
